A simple python script that generates .wav files. It'll make basically every type of noise you can think of and much more. The program prioritizes randomness as a tool for the user to discover new perspectives.

## IF YOU WANT TO USE THE BASE PYTHON FILE, YOU'LL NEED THE FOLLOWING :

<code>pip install tkinter
pip install numpy
pip install scipy</code>

If you don't want to do that, I made an executable that does the same thing, it's gonna be way heavier than the base script since we gotta include Python and all the packages for it to run as a standalone.
